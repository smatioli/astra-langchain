      "Chelsea have finalised an agreement with Southampton to sign midfielder Romeo Lavia, 90min understands. After striking a deal over a fee with the Saints, Chelsea set about finalising the terms of a move which sources have confirmed is worth around Â£58m including add-ons. Southampton director Jason Wilcox confirmed earlier on Tuesday that the two clubs were still in negotiations at that point, but just a few hours later, the Saints have shook hands with Chelsea and are bidding farewell to Lavia. Lavia is due to undergo a medical with Chelsea in the coming days ahead of putting pen to paper on another long-term contract at Stamford Bridge. The Belgian had the opportunity to join Liverpool this summer but, like Moises Caicedo, has opted to join Chelsea instead. feed Should all go to plan with his medical, Lavia will become the latest in a long list of new signings at Chelsea. Alongside Caicedo, the Blues have already recruited Axel Disasi, Christopher Nkunku, Nicolas Jackson, Lesley Ugochukwu, Angelo Gabriel, Robert Sanchez and Diego Moreira this summer, and they are not expected to finish there. Indeed, 90min understands Chelsea have agreed a deal to sign Crystal Palace midfielder Michael Olise, who has a Â£35m release clause in his contract with the Eagles. The Blues are then expected to turn their attention to a new goalkeeper to replace Kepa Arrizabalaga, who has joined Real Madrid on loan, while club officials have not yet ruled out pursuing another striker as well.\n"

      "Saudi Pro League director of football Michael Emenalo claims the competition can position itself as one of the world's best within the next two years by targeting 'exceptional players only' The former technical director of Chelsea assumed his role in July and is continuing the Pro League's significant Â£400m investment initiative. This strategy has enticed players such as Karim Benzema, Jordan Henderson, Riyad Mahrez, and Roberto Firmino to join Saudi Arabian clubs this summer. So far, the majority of top stars heading to Saudi Arabia, including Benzema, N'Golo Kante and Cristiano Ronaldo, have been in the latter stages of their respective careers. At 26, Ruben Neves is one of the exceptions to the trend and arguably not in the same bracket of star anyway. Richard Masters, chief executive of the Premier League, recently shared that he isn't overly worried about Saudi Arabia's unrestricted spending. However, Emenalo cautioned that there are essentially no bounds to the country's willingness to invest in football players.  \"I would loveÂ to have Kylian Mbappe here. I would love to have Harry Kane here. The league would like all the top players,\" he said. Indeed, Mbappe has already been the subject of world record Â£259m bid from Al Hilal that was accepted by Paris Saint-Germain, although the plater himself wasn't interested in the move. manual \"In a couple of years, this will become a league for exceptional players only. It will become a league for those who are at the top of their game. We have the resources, and weâre going to use them,\" Emenalo said. \"I donât think it is going to take the same amount of time that it took the [English] Premier League to get there for us to establish ourselves.\" Emenalo emphasised that the Saudi Pro League's aim is not to undermine the Premier League in a manner similar to LIV Golf and the PGA Tour and hopes that elite football's established order in Europe will eventually be less apprehensive and collaborate with them. âThe European leagues, especially the Premier League, are very strong, they have no reason to be scared,â he added. âI think thereâs panic in some areas, but this is from a misunderstanding of what we are trying to do. âI saw what [Jurgen] Klopp and what [Pep] Guardiola said [about the Pro League]. One is a coach I absolutely admire and the other is a good friend of mine in Pep. First, I hope they donât talk themselves out of a job [in Saudi Arabia] in the future. I understand their concerns. Our goal is to work together with all the leagues and be a brotherhood in the football industry.â\n",

      "Moises Caicedo is no stranger to a drawn-out transfer saga. Years before Chelsea began peppering Brighton with dizzying offers only to be outbid by Liverpool, before the Blues bid Â£115m to secure his services this week, Caicedo was the subject of a multi-club tussle while he was still in Ecuador with Independiente del Valle. Manchester United, AC Milan, Brighton, Chelsea and Belgian side Club Brugge were all interested in the midfielder after a rapid ascension in senior South American football. Three separate agencies also tried to represent Caicedo and get a slice of any potentially lucrative deal. Ultimately, Brighton cut through the chaos to snag Caicedo for just Â£4.5m in 2021. After less than 50 starts for the Seagulls, the 21-year-old has now become one of the most expensive players in the history of the sport. Here's how Caicedo's Â£115m move to Chelsea compares to the game's other costly sagas. Chelsea confirmed the signing of Caicedo after one of the most dramatic transfer sagas of recent times. The Blues had been pursuing the midfielder for the majority of the summer, however had been unwilling to make a bid over Â£80m until Liverpool agreed to fork out Â£111m for his services.  Despite an agreement between Liverpool and Brighton being struck, Caicedo was unwilling to agree to a move to Anfield, opening the door for Chelsea to swoop in and have a Â£115m bid accepted for his services.  The midfielder has now put pen to paper on an eight-year deal at Stamford Bridge.  Caicedo has become the most expensive signing for Chelsea and any other British club. But where does he rank on a global scale? Ranking Player Signed Joined Fee 1 Neymar 2017 PSG Â£198m 2 Kylian Mbappe 2018 PSG Â£163m 3 Philippe Coutinho 2018 Barcelona Â£142m 4 Ousmane Dembele 2017 Barcelona Â£135m 5 Moises Caicedo 2023 Chelsea Â£115m 6 Joao Felix 2019 Atletico Madrid Â£113m 7 Enzo Fernandez 2023 Chelsea Â£107m 8 Antoine Griezmann 2019 Barcelona Â£107m 9 Declan Rice 2023 Arsenal Â£105m 10 Jack Grealish 2021 Manchester City Â£100m Less than four years after making his senior debut as a 17-year-old in the Ecuadorian top flight, Caicedo has become the fifth most expensive footballer of all time.  Even though Caicedo's fee has scratched nine digits, Neymar's move to PSG comfortably remains the most expensive in history, with the Ligue 1 giants paying Â£198m for the forward's services.  Neymar's PSG teammate Kylian Mbappe is second on the list but could have moved into top spot after Al Hilal's Â£259m offer was accepted by the French champions. Mbappe ultimately refused to even meet with representatives of the Saudi giants.\n",

      "Chelsea have announced the British record transfer of Moises Caicedo from Brighton, moving for Â£115m and surpassing the Â£106.8m spent on Enzo Fernandez in January. Caicedo has signed an eight-year contract at Stamford Bridge until 2031. \"I am so happy to join Chelsea!\" the 21-year-old said. \"I am so excited to be here at this big club and I didnât have to think twice when Chelsea called me, I just knew I wanted to sign for the club. Itâs a dream come true to be here and I canât wait to get started with the team.\" Itâs only ever been Chelsea. pic.twitter.com/LCYf6A2BQr Co-sporting directors Laurence Stewart and Paul Winstanley said: \"Moises has proved himself as a standout player in European football over the past 18 months, and we are thrilled to add him toMauricio Pochettinoâs squad. \"Moises possesses a rare midfield skill set and is a player weâve been targeting for some time. We believe he will make a significant impact at Stamford Bridge this season â and in the years ahead.\" Caicedo only joined Brighton in 2021 for as little as Â£4m and spent part of his first year with the club on loan at Beerschot in Belgium. But his rise to becoming one of the best midfielders in the Premier League has been rapid, going from little known prospect to the most expensive player in British football history in the space of just one year. Chelsea have been interested in Caicedo for many months, but until recently their best offer for the Ecuador international was a maximum of Â£80m. Liverpool then looked to have won the race with a Â£111m offer, before Chelsea came back to the table.\n",

      "From Stamford Bridge - The stage was set perfectly. Chelsea and Liverpool had been going at it hammer and tongs in the transfer market in the week leading up to their Premier League fixture at Stamford Bridge on Sunday afternoon. Moises Caicedo was, and remains, the object of their desires. The Brighton midfielder will become the most expensive player in Premier League history when he does eventually transfer, at some point in the coming week, you'd expect, with Liverpool initially having an offer accepted of Â£111m for the Ecuadorian.  Caicedo has made his decision known that he'd prefer the move to west London, triggering public embarrassment for Liverpool - a club usually so efficient and proficient with their dealings to buy and sell first team players.  feed Having won the transfer pending an agreement with Brighton, which will be in the region of a quite ridiculous Â£115m, Chelsea had hoped to present the player to their home support with a deal completed in the days leading up to their 1-1 draw on Sunday. One for the social media channels to rack up the engagements on, y'know, but it wasn't to be. Caicedo wasn't there, but good grief did both teams want him to be, with the need for a dominating defensive midfielder desperately obvious for both throughout a frantic, chaotic 101 minutes of opening weekend action. But what did Sunday's game tell us about which team more desperately needs to break the British transfer record to sign a player with only 53 appearances in English football to his name? Liverpool might need a defensive midfielder, will try to confirm as and when pic.twitter.com/gg4CVUB0wd At least new Chelsea boss Mauricio Pochettino settled for pragmatism (in look and feel at least) as he attempted to cover the lack of defensive presence in midfield by naming a back three. Axel Disasi was named for a competitive debut alongside returning loanee Levi Colwill, with Thiago Silva relied upon in the middle. It suggested at least he was looking to stem the tide and not give too much away - though insisted post-match that his team played with four at the back. For Jurgen Klopp, it was back to gung-ho and heavy metal. You'd suppose you can't name a six in your team if you don't possess one, but Klopp went down the route of \"screw it\" with his team sheet, naming new signings Dominik Szoboszlai and Alexis Mac Allister alongside Cody Gakpo in the most attacking of midfield units.  Mac Allister was tasked with being the deepest midfielder, operating with Trent Alexander-Arnold drifting in from the right full back slot. Who needs Moises Caicedo more? Liverpool, because I'm not changing my system Caicedo is largely praised for his ability to cover ground, shuttling across to cover spaces left behind his teammates with the licence to attack. Fair to say both teams could have really utilised him here - first half especially - and that whichever team gets him will have a gem for next decade in a dream scenario. The opening 45 was a story of Pure, Unadulterated Barclays: Chaos Edition, with both teams' defences breached. Liverpool fired a warning after 12 minutes when Mohamed Salah struck the bar, but hit the front before the 20th minute after some excellent work from the Egyptian. Chelsea left far too much space for Salah to take possession and far too much space behind their back line for Luis Diaz to tap in at the far post. Plenty at fault but good defensive midfielders stop breakaways at source. There'd have been little Caicedo could've done about the way Chelsea's equaliser came about - this was a story of space behind the back line and defenders switching off - but both teams had the ball in the net on a further occasion each only to see efforts ruled out for offside. In the second half, Conor Gallagher far better embraced the role he'd been given for the day as a midfield screen, while 90min POTM Enzo Fernandez grew in stature throughout with an imperious performance in possession. It meant the hosts shaded the second half, controlled the lions' share of possession and the chaos of the game had subsided...barring a frantic final few minutes. Who needs Moises Caicedo more?  Draw, because Conor Gallagher can't play like he did in the second half every week and Liverpool do not own a senior defensive midfielder WhoScored have Chelsea's pass completion at 88% compared to the visitors' 80%, but that could have something to do with Liverpool's direct style on the day and push to get the ball forward. There were spells throughout the first half and before Chelsea found their feet where Liverpool were cutting the hosts open with direct passes through the middle and through the channels, but over the course of the game Chelsea stomped it out. The Blues themselves found moments to penetrate with vertical passes through the middle and often threatened with charges up the pitch from players in possession - they could have won the match late on following a break in that manner. You'd have to chalk Chelsea's name on the board for better use of the ball today on the whole; namely because Enzo Fernandez is very good at football. But both teams have holes to fill. Who needs Moises Caicedo more? Liverpool, because they don't have a six and won't change their system During his time at Brighton, Caicedo was often seen covering in the absence of others at right back - and players nowadays - especially those who cost north of Â£100m - are hugely valued for versatility. Chelsea won't need that kind of cover given their options at right-sided centre back and with Malo Gusto joining the party over the summer and with Reece James named as club captain. Chelsea do need options and numbers in midfield but Caicedo's name is a dream scenario and the completion of a midfield unit. Liverpool, meanwhile, only have 18-year-old Stefan Bajcetic as a natural presence in defensive midfield - and nobody else following the sales of Fabinho and Jordan Henderson, while they rely on Ibrahima Konate to cover three or four positions when Alexander-Arnold steps into midfield and Liverpool don't have the ball. The Reds are in desperate need of a defensive presence in the centre and it would add levels to their game very quickly if they found the right fit. Who needs Moises Caicedo more? Liverpool Based on the evidence of today - from Jurgen Klopp's decision to play Alexis Mac Allister at six while he wore 10 on his back, from Mauricio Pochettino's decision to use a 3-5-2, from the second half performances of Conor Gallagher and Enzo Fernandez and from the apparent ease for opposing teams to progress through Liverpool's centre, you'd have to say it's Liverpool. Their bid has been accepted by Brighton but advances have been halted by the player, with Chelsea now primed to step in and complete the transfer in the week to come. They may even sign up Southampton's Romeo Lavia to really take the biscuit - though Klopp's team are to fight to the end on that one too with no decision from the player yet. If Chelsea do manage to secure their top target for the summer, they'll have a midfield unit of Caicedo and Enzo which will be the envy of the Premier League for seasons to come. It'll have cost in the region of Â£220m for the two, but if you're going for best in class, you've got to spend. Who needs Moises Caicedo more? Liverpool, but they're not getting him are they?\n"
